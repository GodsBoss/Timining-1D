Timining 1D
===========

A minimalistic MineCraft-inspired (read: shamelessly stolen) 1D game (with a 2D view).

Goal
----

Create the crown of geekness, the scepter of coding and build the throne of eternal development. All three require rare gold and even rarer diamonds. Also you have to find the recipes first.

Gameplay
--------

*   Move to the left and right with `a` and `d`.
*   Attack/Chop/Mine with `s`.
*   Open/close build/melt menu with `w`. In menu, choose item with `a` and `d`, enable with `s`.
*   Zombies will attack you, but also drop useful things (sometimes).
*   If you lose all your hearts, you die.
*   Eat and you will slowly regain your health.
*   Build tools for faster chopping/mining.
*   Build weapons to defend yourself.
